## 1. Architecture Overview

The app is a **state machine** with a forward pipeline and a loop-back:

```
EDITOR  →  PHYSICS  →  MESHER  →  SOLVER  →  VISUALIZER
                                                    │
                                                    ▼
                                               EDITOR (loop)
```

Managed entirely in `main.py`. The VISUALIZER state can return to EDITOR (via the "Return to Editor" button), creating a full loop. Each state owns its own module instance. The renderer (`PygameRenderer`) is created once in `main.py` and shared across all modules — **never re-create it**.

---

## 2. Module-by-Module Reference

### `main.py` — Orchestrator
**Owns:** state machine, main loop, OpenGL init, ImGui context creation, camera instance, clock.

**Critical details:**
- ImGui context is created here ONCE (`imgui.create_context()`). Modules must NOT call this themselves.
- The renderer is passed into `Editor`, `PhysicsEditor`, `Mesher` constructors. Don't duplicate it.
- Event handling order matters: `renderer.process_event(event)` must come before any `imgui.get_io().want_capture_mouse` check.
- Camera is created here and passed into every `handle_event()` and `draw()` call — it is the single source of truth for zoom/pan state.
- The fixed-update loop (`accumulator`) is stubbed out and does nothing currently.
- Profiling (`cProfile`) wraps the entire `run_app()` — results print on exit.

**What NOT to touch here:** OpenGL init sequence (`glOrtho`, blend mode). Changing it will break ImGui rendering.

---

### `camera.py` — Coordinate System
**Owns:** world↔screen conversion, all OpenGL drawing primitives.

**The coordinate transform:**
```
screen_x = (world_x + offset[0]) * scale
world_x  = (screen_x / scale) - offset[0]
```
`scale` = pixels per world-unit. `offset` = world-space pan offset.

**Drawing methods (all OpenGL, no Pygame surface):**
- `draw_line(screen, line, ...)` — takes a `Line` object, converts internally.
- `draw_screen_line(screen, p0, p1, ...)` — raw pixel coords, used for previews.
- `draw_polygon(polygon_vertices, screen, ...)` — takes list of `Point` objects.
- `draw_circle(screen, color, center_screen, radius, ...)` — screen coords only.

**Critical:** `screen` parameter is passed everywhere but is essentially unused by the OpenGL calls — it's a legacy argument from when this used Pygame surfaces. Don't remove it; it's threaded through dozens of call sites.

---

### `point.py` — Base Geometry Primitive
**Used everywhere.** Supports: `__eq__`, `__hash__`, `__add__`, `__sub__`, `distance_to()`, `to_tuple()`.

**Critical:** `__hash__` is `hash((self.x, self.y))` — floats. Two points at the same coordinates ARE the same point for set/dict purposes. This is intentional and relied upon by Bowyer-Watson deduplication.

**Watch out:** `__eq__` uses exact float equality (`==`). This is intentional for vertex snapping, but can cause missed matches if coordinates drift by floating-point error. If you ever see "lines don't form a closed loop", check whether `build_polygon()` is comparing Points with `==` via numpy — it uses `np.array_equal(pivot, line.a)` which compares the *object* not coordinates.

---

### `line.py` — CAD Edge / Boundary Segment
Stores two `Point` endpoints (`a`, `b`), plus physics metadata:
- `boundary_type`: `"Wall"` | `"Velocity Inlet"` | `"Pressure Outlet"` (string, set in PhysicsEditor)
- `u_val`, `v_val`, `p_val`: not used by the solver yet (solver reads `inlet_velocity` from PhysicsEditor directly).

`is_mouse_over()` uses projected distance — threshold is in *world units* (5 units). With the current pixel-scale default this is 5 pixels. With mm scale this becomes 5mm — probably fine, but watch it.

`vector` property: returns `[dx, dy]` as a plain list, not a Point or numpy array.

---

### `editor.py` — CAD Module
**State:** `is_drawing` (bool), `start_pos` (Point or None), `lines` (list of Line).

**Click flow:**
1. Screen px → `camera.screen_to_world()` → world Point
2. World Point → `snap_engine.get_snapped_pos()` → snapped world Point
3. First click: store as `start_pos`. Second click: create `Line(start_pos, snapped_pos)`, chain.

**Escape key:** If drawing → cancel current segment. If not drawing → undo last line (pop).

**ImGui:** Renders a "Finish CAD" button. `finished` flag triggers state transition in `main.py`. The tooltip (length/dx/dy) is rendered as a floating ImGui window that follows the cursor.

---

### `snapengine.py` — Snap Logic
Two snap modes:
1. **Vertex snap** — checks all line endpoints within `pixel_radius / camera.scale` world units.
2. **Axis snap** — if cursor is within `world_radius` of `anchor_pos` on X or Y axis, locks that axis.

Returns a `Point`. The returned Point may be a reference to an *existing* endpoint — this is important for polygon closure.

---

### `physics_editor.py` — BC & Mesh Parameter Configurator
**Sits between EDITOR and MESHER.** Has no mesh logic itself; purely UI + data.

**Outputs (passed to Mesher constructor):**
| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `n_layers` | 4 | Boundary layer count |
| `growth_factor` | 1.1 | Layer thickness multiplier |
| `thickness` | 1.0 | First layer thickness (world units) |
| `boundary_spacing` | 6.0 | Arc length between boundary points (world units) |
 | `r` | 4.0 | Steiner point minimum separation (world units) |
| `inlet_velocity` | 1 | m/s (SI, not world units) |
| `outlet_pressure` | 0 | Pa (SI) |
| `density` | 1.2 | kg/m³ (SI) |
| `viscosity` | 0.002 | Pa·s (SI) |

**Refinement zones:** `refinement_zones` is a list of dicts `{ 'rect': (x1, y1, x2, y2), 'factor': float }`. Each zone is a rectangle drawn by the user (click-drag on canvas). The `factor` divides the global `r` to get the local Steiner spacing: `local_r = r / factor`. The UI shows the resulting mesh size (`r / factor`) next to each zone. Zones are converted to `(shapely_polygon, factor)` tuples via `_get_refinement_polygons()` and passed to the Mesher. **Zones persist across mesh save/load** — they are serialized as polygon exterior coords + factor in the `.npz` file and restored into `physicseditor.refinement_zones` on load.

**BC assignment:** Clicking a line (via `handle_selection`) opens a per-line ImGui window. The `boundary_types` list order matters — index maps to the combo box index AND to the `bc_map` in Mesher.

**Important:** `inlet_velocity` is a single float here, but the Solver receives `[inlet_velocity, 0.0]` — a 2D vector. This is assembled in `main.py`.

---

### `mesher.py` — Mesh Generation Engine
The most complex module. Four main phases:

#### Phase 1: Boundary Points (`create_boundary_points`)
- Orders lines via `build_polygon()` into a consistent loop.
- Samples each edge uniformly at `boundary_spacing` intervals → `self.boundary_points` (Nx2 numpy array).
- Simultaneously builds `self.thickness_mask` (which points are on walls → get BL offsets) and `self.point_bc_mask` (integer BC tags: 0=Wall, 1=Inlet, 2=Outlet).
- `bc_map` must match the string values in `physics_editor.py → boundary_types` exactly.

#### Phase 2: Boundary Layers (`boundary_layer`, `connect_layers`)
- `boundary_layer()` offsets a ring of points inward using miter vectors. Handles CCW/CW correctly via `self.orientation`.
- `connect_layers()` stitches adjacent rings into Quads, degenerating to Triangles when an edge collapses (pinched corners).
- Output: `self.boundary_elements` (list of Quad and Triangle objects).

**Watch out:** `polygon_orientation()` returns `area_signed`. If positive → CW → normals flipped. If the boundary layer grows outward instead of inward, check this sign and the normal formula in `boundary_layer()`.

#### Phase 3: Steiner Points (`create_steiner_points`)
- Poisson-disk sampling using Bridson's algorithm with a spatial grid.
- Uses Shapely for the `safe_zone` (polygon buffered inward by `min_r * 0.8`, where `min_r` is the smallest spacing across all refinement zones — this lets Steiner points sit closer to prismatic layers when refinement is active).
- Grid cell size `w = min_r / sqrt(2)` (sized for the densest zone).
- **Refinement zones**: If `self.refinement_zones` is non-empty, a single unified Poisson-disk pass fills all zones + background simultaneously. Each zone gets a guaranteed seed at its centroid (so overlapping/disconnected zone arms are all populated). The spacing at each candidate is determined by `_get_local_r()` which uses signed-distance blending (smoothstep over a `5 * r` buffer) to transition smoothly from `r/factor` inside a zone to `r` outside — avoiding sudden cell-size jumps that cause solver artefacts.
- Hard cap at 2000×2000 grid cells — if triggered, `w` is rescaled to fit.

#### Phase 4: Triangulation & Filter
- Calls `Bowyer_watson(all_interior_pts)`.
- `filter_triangles()` removes triangles outside the inner ring using `matplotlib.path.Path.contains_points`.

#### Distance-Weighted Interpolation (`_gx_int`)
- Computed once in `_precompute_topology()` (lines 202-214) as `self._gx_int = d_Pf / d_PN`, where `d_Pf` is the distance from the owner cell center to the shared face midpoint and `d_PN` is the total owner→neighbor center distance (`magDf`).
- Replaces the implicit **0.5 arithmetic mean** (`0.5 * (U_own + U_nei)`) with proper distance-weighted interpolation: `U_interp = (1 - g_x) * U_own + g_x * U_nei`.
- Applied consistently to: velocity interpolation at faces (`U_interp` in `_compute_rhie_chow_flux` and `SIMPLE_UPDATE_FACE_FLUX_AND_DIFFUSSION`), pressure gradient interpolation (`gP_f`), coupling coefficient `a_P_f` (the `d = Sf²/a_P` term), cell volume/area interpolation (`vol_f`), and pressure face value `p_face` in the momentum RHS.
- **Why it matters:** On a uniform mesh `g_x = 0.5` exactly, so behavior is identical to before. On a refined/non-uniform mesh (small refined cell next to a large coarse cell), the face midpoint is much closer to the small cell's center — the 0.5 average biased interpolation toward the wrong cell, creating artificial pressure gradients that made refinement zones behave like solid bodies (numerical "resistance"). The distance-weighted form is the textbook-correct approach for non-uniform/skewed unstructured meshes and is what makes the v1.2.0 refinement zones numerically sound.
- Precomputed once (mesh topology is fixed during the solve) — zero per-iteration cost.

#### `solver_data_pipeline()`
The final output generator. Returns the mesh dict the Solver expects. Key steps:
1. Builds `bc_lookup` (edge → BC tag) from boundary points.
2. Merges boundary elements + triangles into `Cells`.
3. Builds `edge_map` (edge key → list of cell IDs). An edge with 1 cell is a boundary face.
4. Populates `owner`, `neighbor`, `Sf`, `Cf`, `df`, `magDf`, `boundary_tags`.
5. Boundary face tagging: nearest boundary segment search (within 1.0 world unit tolerance).

**Critical implementation note:** Edge keys are `(round(x,6), round(y,6))` sorted tuples. This rounding is essential — without it, floating-point jitter creates duplicate edges. Don't change the rounding precision without testing.

**The 1.0 tolerance in boundary tagging:** `if min_dist < 1.0` — this is in world units. If geometry is in mm (small numbers), this is 1mm, which is fine. If geometry were in metres, you'd need to scale this.

### `bowyerwatson.py` — Delaunay Triangulation
Standard Bowyer-Watson. Inputs: list of `Point` objects. Outputs: `Triangulation`.

**Deduplication:** `list(set(input_points))` — relies on `Point.__hash__`. Important: if two points have the same coordinates, only one survives. This is intentional (prevents degenerate triangles).

**Super-triangle cleanup:** Vertices of the super-triangle are kept in `super_verts` as a set and compared with triangle vertices. Since Point hash is coordinate-based, as long as no input point coincidentally matches a super-triangle vertex (very unlikely with the 20×dmax scale), this is safe.

---

### `constructor.py` — Geometry Helpers
- `create_super_triangle`: scale factor 20 on `dmax`. Safe for normal geometries; could theoretically cause precision issues if input points span many orders of magnitude.
- `checkCircumcentre`: standard determinant incircle test. Calls `orientCCW` first for consistency.
- `orientCCW`: mutates the triangle in-place by swapping b/c if CW. **Side effect** — be aware when debugging triangle winding.
- `intersect`: line-line intersection via Cramér's rule. Used by mesher (imported but check where).

---

### `triangle.py` / `quad.py` — Cell Geometry
Both implement the same interface: `vertices()`, `edges()`, `centroid` (property), `area` (property), `draw()`.

`edges()` returns `frozenset` pairs — this is what Bowyer-Watson and `edge_map` use as keys. **The frozenset hashing is what makes edge matching work.**

`Triangle.area`: cross-product formula, absolute value — always positive.
`Quad.area`: Shoelace formula, absolute value.
`Quad.centroid`: polygon centroid formula (not simple average) — important for irregular quads.

---

### `triangulation.py` — Triangle Container
O(1) add/remove container backed by a pre-allocated NumPy array. `remove_triangle` uses a `_tri_to_idx` dict (keyed by `id(triangle)`) for O(1) lookup, then swaps the vacated slot with the last row (swap-with-last) so the array stays compact. `coords` property returns a zero-copy view of the live rows — no list conversion, no `np.asarray` copy.

## 4. The Units Problem (Current State)

### Root Cause
World coordinates were historically pixels. Camera started with `scale=1.0` meaning 1 world unit = 1 screen pixel. The editor never had a physical unit concept.

### Consequence
A 640-pixel-wide drawing = 640 "world units" fed to the solver as 640 metres. At those scales, Reynolds numbers are enormous, Kolmogorov scales are microscopic, and the solver is solving a physically absurd problem.

### Where Units Live
| Module | What's in world units | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `camera.py` | `scale` (px/world-unit), `offset` | Transform only — no physics |
| `physics_editor.py` | `thickness`, `boundary_spacing`, `r` | Defaults assume old pixel scale |
| `mesher.py` | `boundary_points`, all coords, `Sf`, `Cf`, `df`, `magDf`, `cell_areas` | Pipeline output in world units |
| `solver.py` | Everything in `mesher_data` dict | Expects SI (metres) |

### What Does NOT Need Unit Conversion
- `inlet_velocity` (m/s, already SI)
- `outlet_pressure` (Pa, already SI)
- `density`, `viscosity` (SI)
- `n_layers`, `growth_factor` (dimensionless)

## 5. Things You Must NOT Break

1. **`renderer` singleton** — created once in `main.py`, passed everywhere. Never instantiate `PygameRenderer` in a module.
2. **Edge key rounding** — the `round(..., 6)` in `get_edge_key()` inside `solver_data_pipeline()`. Change precision and the edge map breaks silently.
3. **`frozenset` edges** — Triangle and Quad both use frozenset for edges. Changing to tuples breaks all dict lookups.
4. **`orientCCW` mutation** — `constructor.orientCCW()` mutates the triangle. The Bowyer-Watson loop calls `checkCircumcentre` which calls `orientCCW`. Don't assume triangle vertex order is stable after this.
5. **`polygon_orientation` sign convention** — Positive = CW in the shoelace convention used here (note: this is *opposite* to the standard mathematical convention where positive area = CCW). The `boundary_layer` normal-flip depends on this.
6. **`build_polygon` comparison** — Uses `pivot == line.a` (i.e. `Point.__eq__`). `Point.__eq__` now uses a tight tolerance (`math.isclose`, abs_tol=1e-9) so it is robust to small coordinate drift while still treating distinct vertices as distinct. **`Point.__hash__` is intentionally left as the exact coordinate hash** — Bowyer-Watson dedup (`set()` on Points) relies on bit-identical coordinates, so do NOT make `__hash__` tolerance-based.
7. **`bc_map` string matching** — The strings in `bc_map` in `create_boundary_points()` must exactly match the `boundary_types` list in `physics_editor.py`.
8. **Distance-weighted interpolation (`_gx_int`)** — The solver uses `self._gx_int = d_Pf / d_PN` (distance from owner cell center to face midpoint, over total owner→neighbor distance) for all face interpolations (velocity, pressure gradient, coupling coefficient `a_P_f`, cell volume, `p_face`). Do NOT replace this with a fixed `0.5` arithmetic mean — on non-uniform/refined meshes the 0.5 average biases interpolation toward the wrong cell, creating artificial pressure gradients that make refinement zones behave like solid bodies. On uniform meshes `g_x = 0.5` exactly, so the distance-weighted form is strictly a superset.

---

## 6. Known Issues / Technical Debt

- `line.py`: `u_val`, `v_val`, `p_val` are unused (future per-line BC values).
- `solver.py → health_check()` prints every iteration — verbose, should be gated.
- `data_structures.txt` is partially outdated — `magSf` was added later and is in the actual pipeline but not the txt.
- The solver runs synchronously in the SOLVER state and blocks the UI until convergence (no progress rendering mid-solve).

### Resolved technical debt (this pass)
- **Steiner grid OOB crash** — `get_grid_coords` in `create_steiner_points` now clamps indices to `[0, cols-1]`/`[0, rows-1]`, fixing an `IndexError` when a candidate landed exactly on the polygon bounds.
- **`create_steiner_points` default `r=550`** aligned to `4.0` to match `physics_editor` (was a latent mismatch).
- **`build_polygon` comparison** switched from `np.array_equal` (object identity through numpy) to `Point.__eq__` (tolerance-based) — see rule 6 above.
- **`Point.__eq__`** now uses `math.isclose` (abs_tol=1e-9) instead of exact float equality; `__hash__` left exact on purpose.
- **Boundary-face tagging tolerance** in `solver_data_pipeline()` is now `self.boundary_spacing` (scale-aware) instead of a hard-coded `1.0` world unit, so metre-scale geometries tag correctly.
- **Visualizer probe centroid** now reuses `cell.centroid` (shoelace for quads) instead of a naive vertex average, matching the solver's geometry.
- **Dead code removed**: `mesher.check_points()`, `mesher.create_boundary_layers()`, `constructor.intersect()`/`cross2d()`, and the empty `while accumulator >= dt` body in `main.py`.
- **Misleading comment** in `editor.py` ("Default to meters") corrected to reflect the actual mm default.
